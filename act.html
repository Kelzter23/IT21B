    <h1 class="c2">Peter Gene Hernandez (born October 8, 1985), known professionally as Bruno Mars, is an American singer-songwriter.
         He is known for his stage performances, retro showmanship, and for performing in a wide range of musical styles, including pop,
          R&B, funk, soul, reggae, disco, and rock. 
          
          As a young teenager, he appeared in a local revue impersonating Michael Jackson, and he taught himself to play piano, guitar, bass, and percussion.
           After graduating from high school, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career as a musician. About that time he took the stage name Bruno Mars.

         His father was a Latin percussionist and his mother was a singer. Mars grew up listening to a mix of reggae, rock, and R&B music,
            which would later influence his own sound. Despite his love for music, Mars faced several challenges early on in his career.</h1>

         four Brit Awards, eleven American Music Awards, 
         13 Soul Train Awards and holds three Guinness World Records, among other accolades.
